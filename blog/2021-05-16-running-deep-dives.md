For the last few months, we have held what we call a Deep Dive most Thursday evening. With 
"Deep Dive" I mean an approximately 60 min presentation and discussion on a fairly narrow technical
subject, that often includes a short coding session as well.

We hold these sessions in the Vector Monkey Coding Dojo Discord server, they are free of charge and
open to anyone.

In the currently running series of topics, we have been looking closely at some of the answers to a
Quora question labeled
[Quora question](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-basics-you-want-all-your-software-developers-to-know "What are the basics you want all your software developers to know?").

I'm especially fond of the answer by Martin Thoma, who lists 11 points of background knowledge and
skills that are mostly useful to a Software Engineer, no matter what tech stack, framework and
programming language they are working with.

In general, we have been using the format of one point per week, though we have split up some of the
points into multiple Deep Dives.

We are currently getting close to the end of this block, with only a few points still left 
undiscussed.


If you are interested in joining us on the next Deep Dive, just say hi in the 
[Discord Link](https://discord.gg/8VsPfKu8UY "Vector Monkey Discord Channel") next Thursday,
20:15 CET.

*Finally the day of my graduation from the wizard school of Remingdell had come, the day I had been 
waiting for so long! Today I was going to receive my wizard degree and from there on I was free to 
explore the wonders of the world and become a great mage. Excitement filled my chest, when thinking 
about the future.*

*But for my dream to become true, I had one last mission to complete: getting the signature of the archmage Xidius Razam, headmaster of the wizard school of Remingdell and high wizard of the circle 
of Baal, for my graduation letter.
Honestly, I was surprised to hear that I had to bring the letter to him in person, it seems so much 
easier to send an owl...*

*According to what I had heard about the archmage, he was a brilliant man, but had his 
idiosyncrasies. One of which was that he wanted to meet every graduate from the wizard school 
personally, but he was usually too busy to attend the graduation ceremonies. Frankly, I had hoped 
he might show up for mine, but I hadn’t been so lucky... Therefore I had to go on a journey to his residence close to a small village called Bellwick.*

*Slightly annoyed and with a heavy heart when thinking about leaving all my friends and the small 
room which I had called home over the last years, I started to pack my stuff. At least I would have 
my closest friend, my wizard animal Krumbein, at my side.*

*After an emotional farewell and a promise to my best friend Samarah to get in touch as soon as 
possible, I started to walk north, with a clear goal in mind.*

Our currently ongoing team project is a pixel art RPG game called **Endless Dungeon**, which we 
develop during group coding sessions, usually taking place once per month (find more information 
[here](/projects "projects")). Besides writing code, design and story telling are two major factors contributing to a fun and engaging gameplay.

Therefore this ongoing "Meet the ..."-series centeres around these two building blocks, no technical 
talk included ;)

I decided on a short story format that describes a small panning from the life of each character, 
together with the presentation of the character's avatar, designed by our awesome designer **Daniel**.

# Mission Statement
The Vector Monkeys Coding Dojo was formed to provide people of all genders, backgrounds and 
preferences the chance to become Software Engineers.

This means a few things to us that might not be immediately obvious.
### Minimal prior knowledge required
We start at the basics as far as reasonably possible.
A basic understanding of maths, basic computer usage and a certain fluidity in English is all 
we want to require.
### Minimal financial burdens
We feel strongly about the difference socioeconomic background has 
on the likely paths that we, individually, can take. We do not charge for any part of the course 
program, and do not use any material, software or licence that requires purchase. That being 
said, we do require a working computer, an internet connection and a workable audio setup for 
remote conferencing.
### Focus on job relevant skills
We welcome anyone who is interested in learning how to write a 
computer program, aiming to become a Software Engineer is strictly not required. That being said, 
a part of our courses and events focus on the interviewing process, tools and strategies used by 
Software Enginners, and on collaborating in a team.

## What we offer
The Dojo aims to create and foster a community of people interested in coding, and to give them 
ongoing opportunities to deepen their knowledge and their skills. There are four major parts to this.

## Weekly small-group courses
The heart of the project is a 3 month long, weekly 2 hour course 
with accompanying exercises, held remotely in a small-group format (~5 people). Aim of the 
course is to bring complete beginners to a point where they are comfortable writing small React 
apps. The course focuses on the frontend side of things, mostly since there is more immediate 
feedback. During the 3 months, students will get familiarity with
* webdesign with HTML5, CSS3
* JavaScript and to some extend TypeScript
* Linux and potentially WSL
* Node.js, npm
* React, Redux, jest, react-static
* git, GitHub, Visual Studio Code, eslint
## Weekly "deep-dives"
We also offer weekly, approx. one-hour long presentations on specific 
programming related topics, often but not always focused on web technologies. These are intended 
to maintain interest and learning, and to offer a place for discussions on technologies and 
current events. Deep dives are always remote, typically in Discord.
## Monthly team coding sessions
Understanding small examples is very different from being able to 
reason through and contribute to actual complex code bases. To help with the latter, the Vector 
Monkeys Coding Dojo holds ~12 hour session one weekend a month where we work on some reasonably 
complex project, including task management (we use Trello), design documents, story maps, code 
reviews and collaboration sessions. The current project is a Phaser.js pixel art game, targeted 
for web and mobile platforms.
## Resource collection
There are lots of great coursewares, programming challenges and tutorials 
online and freely available already. As such, we don't have a huge collection of material that 
is specific to us. What we do try to provide is a first guide on how to start your journey. That 
includes a set of instructions for getting to a sensible starting point in terms of 
configuration and software for writing code, a basic set of tutorials on the basics of 
JavaScript, and a set of story-driven programming challenges that go hand in hand with the 
tutorials.

We also try to bring people interested in becoming Software Engineers together with people who are 
interested in hiring Software Engineers. And we have a Discord channel.

If you are interested in any of the above, drop us a line under ###Link-to-contact###.

## How we think about learning
We believe that, in order to improve a skill, the most relevant quality is consistency.

To that end, we care about providing interesting challenges and examples and keeping students 
motivated. As such, we aim for
* tasks with visual feedback,
* community engagement,
* story lines over encapsulated problems,
* incremental difficulty increases and
* continuous engagement.

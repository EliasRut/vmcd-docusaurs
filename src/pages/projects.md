# Projects
The Vector Monkeys Coding Dojo regularly gets together to work on coding projects of a reasonable
size as a team.

We do this to build knowledge about and experience in working with tools that are standard in the
Software Engineering process, such as Git, Trello and Visual Studio Code. And because it's fun.

## Codename "Endless Dungeon"
Our currently ongoing team project is a pixel art RPG, targeted at the web and at mobile platforms, 
written in TypeScript. We make use of the awesome Phaser.js framework for handling much of the
game mechanics.

Our get-togethers are currently completely digital and happen about once a month, where we then
spend most of a day working on the project.

The GitHub repo is public and can be found under https://github.com/EliasRut/Endless-Dungeon.

title: Introduction

In this part of the course, we will set up your local development environment so that you are ready
to handle the challenges of the story. This will consist of two steps:

1. Loading your computers state (aka, getting the source code)
2. Booting up the ship's computer core (aka, running the source code)

## Loading your computers state
Since your ship's computer runs on good old Git, the easiest way to get your computer source code
into Visual Studio Code is to just clone the Git repository. 

You will be navigating in the terminal by using the **cd** command, which stands for
**c**hange **d**irectory.

To do that, let's start by opening a terminal. Once you've got that open, navigate to the directory
where you want to copy the source code folder into by using
```
cd path/to/your/code/folder
```
where **path/to/your/code/folder** is the path to a folder of your choosing. Having all your code in
one root folder is recommended, and keep in mind that git clone will create a new folder within
your chosen folder.
You can also use
```
cd ..
```
to change back to the parent directory. Finally, if you want to create a new folder, you can use
```
mkdir folderName
```
**mkdir** is a unix command that stands for **m**a**k**e **dir**ectory.

Once you are where you want to be, you can start the code download by executing
```
git clone https://github.com/EliasRut/distant-stars.git
```
which will pull the latest version of the master branch into a newly created distant-stars folder.
Now all you need to do is to navigate into that new folder, and open your code editor. Of course you
will use the one and only code editor that is fully endorsed and recommended by Space Academy, 
Visual Studio Code. You can do this by executing the following in your terminal
```
cd distant-stars
code .
```
**code** is the command to open Visual Studio Code from your terminal, and the **.** will set the
open working directory to be the directory you are currently in.

## Booting up your systems
To see the current state of your ship's computer system, you can use the **start** script 
defined in the repositories package.json file. This script uses the **node** command to start up
the mainframe and run the system diagnostics test, and reads as follows
```
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node src/coreSystems/mainframe.js && node src/coreSystems/systemControlIntegration.js"
  },
```

To run this script, we can make use of the node package manager, that knows about everything 
happening in the package.json file. Node package manager, or **npm** for short, is a set of tools
for dealing with JavaScript projects, from handling dependencies to setting up new projects and
running node scripts. The **npm run scriptName** command can be used to start any scripts defined
in the scripts section of your package.json file.

Let's get started by running
```
npm run start
```

This should produce an output similar to this one
```
                     `. ___
                    __,' __`.                _..----....____
        __...--.'``;.   ,.   ;``--..__     .'    ,-._    _.-'
  _..-''-------'   `'   `'   `'     O ``-''._   (,;') _,'
,'________________                          \`-._`-','
 `._              ```````````------...___   '-.._'-:
    ```--.._      ,.                     ````--...__\-.
            `.--. `-`                       ____    |  |`
              `. `.                       ,'`````.  ;  ;`
                `._`.        __________   `.      \'__/`
                   `-:._____/______/___/____`.     \  `
                               |       `._    `.    \
                               `._________`-.   `.   `.___
                                                  `------'`

### Understanding the system output
This code base is setup in such a way that, assuming only typical erros, you should always at least
get to the line stating
```
Loading system control software...
```
If you produced an error that stops node from even running your code, you will now see an error
message followed by what is called a stack trace, listing where your error is. Something like this
```
Starting mainframe....
-> Mainframe systems loaded.
Loading system control software...

followed by a list of main system checks, one for each of the lessons that make up this
course - and you get

Finally, you'll get a list of subsystems that represent individual tasks of the current unfinished
lesson. Assuming you have not solved any tasks yet, you will see

telling you that the **bridge control** chapter is the next one that is unfinished, and that the
three tasks in it are currently failing.

## Next steps
This is the end of the introduction lesson. The next one will be your first step into writing code,
and deals with **value types**, the basics of **functions** and the **return** statement.
